### Running the Project
To ensure the project runs smoothly without any CORS issues, use `Live Server` or any `local server` setup. To create a local server, you can simply use the command:

```bash
npx http-server
```

The Diagnosis History section dynamically fetches data based on your current visit date. If you see 0 values under the `Last 6 Months` option, switch to the `Last 12 Months` option in the dropdown to view a full dataset. This will ensure all historical data appears as expected.
